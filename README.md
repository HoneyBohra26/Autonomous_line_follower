The Line Follower Robot project involves designing and developing an autonomous robot capable of tracking contrasting lines on the ground to navigate to a specified finish point.The robot's primary function is to follow a line,a white line on a black surface, and it does this through the use of infrared (IR) sensors that detect the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface.

The programming for this line follower robot was accomplished using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The Arduino IDE allowed for the writing, compiling, and uploading of code to the Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the brain of the robot. The code was specifically designed to process data from the IR sensors to enable precise control and navigation. These sensors are positioned on the underside of the robot, close to the ground, and they continuously monitor the surface for changes in color. When the sensors detect the contrasting line, they send signals to the microcontroller, which then adjusts the robot's direction and speed to keep it on track.

To assemble and power the robot, several key components were utilized. The core component is the Arduino Uno, a widely used microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. The Arduino Uno was chosen for its simplicity, versatility, and ease of programming. The L293D motor driver was employed to control the motors responsible for the robot's movement. This motor driver is capable of driving two motors independently, making it ideal for controlling the left and right wheels of the robot. The IR sensors were critical for detecting the line, and their signals were processed by the Arduino to determine the robot's path. Additionally, the LM7805 voltage regulator was used to ensure a stable power supply to the components, converting the higher voltage from the batteries to a regulated 5V, which is required by the Arduino and other electronic components.

The development of this line follower robot provided valuable hands-on experience with various aspects of robotics and embedded systems, including sensor integration, motor control, and power management, circuit designing. The project required careful planning and implementation to ensure that the robot could reliably follow the line and navigate the course. Through iterative testing and refinement, the robot's performance was optimized, resulting in a functional autonomous vehicle capable of completing its designated task efficiently. This project not only demonstrated the practical application of theoretical knowledge but also enhanced problem-solving skills and understanding of real-world robotics challenges.
